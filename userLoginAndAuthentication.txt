Register: POST /api/users{name, email, password}
Login: POST /api/logins

email:{
type:String,
unique:true,
}

in function validateUser(){

 email: Joi.string().min(3).required().email().max(255),}
 
 User.findOne({email:...}) finds an object in the database if email mathches

 Lodash.com
 utility functions for working with various types
 convention says you call the instantiation of lodash '_' so:
 const _ = require("lodash");
 then to use it
 _.pick(user, ['name', email]) for example
 
 or to pick just the properties you want from a post request use
 user= new User(_.pick(req.body, ['name', 'email','password'])
 
 joi password comlexity will help validate passwords

 hashing passwords
 
 use npm i bcrypt
 const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
 to hash you need a salt.
 a salt is a random string that is inserted before the password is hashed
 this helps keep the hashing from being deciphered
 
 await salt = bcrypt.genSalt(10) //the higher the number the longer it takes and the more comples the string
 const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('myPassword', salt)

 authenticating users
 auth.js is usually the name of the file for 
 
 here we created an auth.js file, the crux of the bicky is:
 const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);
  if (!validPassword) return res.status(400).send("Invalid email or password");
  res.send(true);
  
  bcrypt apparently knows what the salt is for comparison. not quite sure how that works?

  return json webtoken
  its a long string that identifies a user it is passed to the 
  user so that next time it makes a request it has to use the token
  the client will have to store this token, be it a browser or other client  
  jwt.io => this is a url, check it out
  it has a token debugger that lets you inspect the token
  this token has a payload that includes public properties about the user
  
  the signature is based on the content and a secret key that is only 
  available on the server.
  
 ++++++++++++++++ generating tokens
 npm i jsonwebtoken
 this creates a token
 const token = jwt.sign({_id: user._id}, 'jwtPrivateKey')
 -- don't store the private key in the source code, this is just an examplethe 
 the iat property is time of creation
 Move the jwtPrivateKey in an environment variable
 npm i config
 -- this will let you futz with environment variables
 create default.json in config folder in project
 {
  "jwtPrivateKey": ""
}

 create custom-environment-variables.json in config folder
 {
  "jwtPrivateKey": "vidly_jwtPrivateKey"
}

 
 
 don't forget to invoke config
 set the environment variable to the desired string for the key in the console:
 cmd> set vidly_jwtPrivateKey=myPrivateKey
 
 add const config = require("config"); to index.js
 also add the following to index.js
 if (!config.get("jwtPrivateKey")) {
  console.error("FATAL ERROR:jwtPrivateKey");
  process.exit(1);
} - this will make the program exit if there is no secret key
send the  token to the client with the following in auth.js
 const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, config.get("jwtPrivateKey"));
 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
setting response headers

the above code will return the token in the body of the response
for vidly we want to assume the user is logged in once the account is created
they dont need email verification
so we'll return the token in the header when the user is created in the post route


const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, config.get("jwtPrivateKey"));)
res.header('x-auth-token'//prefix with x and add an arbitrary name , so..
res.header('x-auth-token', token).send(_.pick (user, ["_id", "name", "email"])); 

store this json webtoken on the client and send it to the server next time you make an api call






++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
encapsulating logic in mongoose models
in users module a webtoken gets generated, the same code exists in auth.js
the payload is the same in each file, so the generation should be encapsulated in a single place
for easier code maintenance

//information expert principle, the object that has the most knowledge should have
// control over its methods, ie the user object has all of the user properities so
// the user token generation should occur within the user module
so add a function there:
This gets whacky.
we add a function or a method to the userSchema with:
userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = funciton(){
const token = jwt.sign({_id: this._id},config.get('jwtPrivateKey'))
}

then call token = user.generateAuthToken() where we need the token
ie auth.js and users.js

authorization middleware

the router.post should only be authorized by an authenticated user
so in the post method
read the header and validate it
in order to not have to put it at the beginning of every route handler we
put the auth function in middleware
create a new folder called middle
and create a file called auth.js
function auth(req, res, next){
const token = req.header('x-auth-token')
if(!token) res.status(401).send('access denied, no token provided')

try{
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, config.get('jwtPrivateKey')
req.user = decoded;
next(); //next passes control to the next middleware function
}
catch(ex){
res.status(400).send('Invalid token')}
}

module.exports = auth;

decoded is the decoded payload from the req and will be used to check
against the payload encoded in user.generateAuthToken

to use the auth middleware function, in the route file you want to protect
include the auth middleware function
const auth = require('../middleware/auth')
and then in the route call, add the middleware
router.post('/', auth, async(req,res)....)

when testing this don't forget to set the environment variable
with set vidly_jwtPrivateKey=myprivatkee


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
getting the current user
creaete a new route, the client has to submit a valid token in the header
so the header should include
x-auth-token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ..........


router.get("/me", auth, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select("-password");
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send("user was not found");
  res.send(user);
});

will return the user
-notice it doesnt return the password

logging out only requires that the client deletes the token


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Role Based Authorization
add user type to user.js
inSchema add:
isAdmin:Boolean

then when you generat the authtoke add this property:
isAdmin: this.isAdmin
add to middleware 
admin.js =>
module.exports = function (req, res, next)
{
	if (!req.user.isAdmin) return res.status(403).send(access denied)  // forbidden
	next();
}
use an array in route definitions for multiple middlewares



create a new user, 
when you create a new user it generates an auth token, this will have  no isAdmin flag
add the isAdmin in the database
authorize the user
this will create a new token that has the isAdmin boolean
use this second webtoken for any request that requires admin Priviledges
 headers: x-auth-token:newToken

get a token with a post to auth.
check the token with jwt.io
use this token as the
